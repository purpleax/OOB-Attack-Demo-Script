# Out-of-Band Attack Simulation Script

This repository contains a Python script designed to simulate a range of out-of-band (OOB) attacks for educational and testing purposes. The script includes simulations for common vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL Injection, XXE, Command Injection, Remote Code Execution (RCE), and the Log4j vulnerability.

## Features

- **HTTP Attack Simulation**: Sends malicious payloads via HTTP GET requests to a specified target server.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Attack Simulation**: Injects a script tag via URL to simulate XSS.
- **SQL Injection Simulation**: Attempts SQLi through URL parameters.
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Attack Simulation**: Sends malicious XML data to the server.
- **Command Injection Simulation**: Executes a system command through the web application.
- **Remote Code Execution Simulation**: Attempts to execute a remote script or command.
- **Log4j Vulnerability Simulation**: Simulates the Log4j vulnerability by injecting a malicious JNDI lookup.

## Usage

To use the script, you need Python installed on your machine along with the `requests` library. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions and ethical clearance to test the target servers, as this script simulates real attack vectors.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/oob-attack-simulation.git

# Navigate to the script directory
cd oob-attack-simulation

# Install necessary Python libraries
pip install requests

# Run the script
python oob-attack.py


Configuration

# Define the target webserver where all requests will be sent
target_webserver = 'https://www.yourtargetserver.com'

# List of out-of-band domains to be used in the attack simulation payloads
oob_domains = [
    "yourdomain1.com", "yourdomain2.com", ... 
]
